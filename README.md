# MusicCognition
An analysis of music cognition. 

Within this repository, you will find implementations of neural networks achieving music-related cognitive tasks. The overall goal is to understand different mechanisms by which NNs achieve cognitive tasks and analyse the biological plausibility of the NN architectures.

This is a work in progress - the repository will be appended as the project goes along.
